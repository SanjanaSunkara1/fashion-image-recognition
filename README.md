# 👗 Fashion Image Recognition  

A starter project that explores how machines can **recognize clothing items** from images using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**. This repo provides scrambled starter code, balanced sample CSVs, and environment files so you can practice assembling, running, and extending an image recognition pipeline.

## ✨ Features  

-  **Balanced Data Samples**: Includes `fashion_mnist_20bal_train.csv` and `fashion_mnist_20bal_test.csv` with 20 examples per class.  
-  **Starter Code**: `main.py` with cut-here markers — practice piecing code blocks together into a runnable program.  
-  **Utility Setup**: Poetry and pip support for smooth dependency management.  
-  **Cloud Ready**: `replit.nix` for quick execution in Replit.  
-  **Extendable**: Build your own models, add arguments, or visualize predictions.
